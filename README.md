# Workflow demo

Recently I demoed a small end-to-end proof of concept for SCP Workflow at UI5con 2018 in Walldorf, Germany. Since it seems to have been fairly well received and people have expressed interest in it, I decided to write a how-to guide on how to set up SAP Cloud Platform workflow and optionally deploy the demo apps that I have prepared to get you started. 

For the SAP spiel about workflow and pricing options, have a look at the [introduction page](https://cloudplatform.sap.com/dmp/capabilities/us/product/SAP-Cloud-Platform-Workflow/df696e5a-d973-4ecd-8d8d-532d60aa1921) here. 

### This document covers:
1. activating workflow on your trial account dashboard and WebIDE
1. allocating all workflow authorisation roles to your user
1. optionally, installing the demo applications consisting of
    1. an app you can deploy to the launchpad to start a workflow
    1. an inbox application for your approve and reject scenarios
    1. a small but complete workflow with service-, user- and script tasks
    1. the setup of a destination on your account if you want to showcase an API call I have prepared
  

### 1. Activating workflow

##### On the dashboard
Workflow is provided as a service on your SCP Dashboard like everything else. Its prerequisites are the activation of the portal (launchpad) and the WebIDE so head over to the services link and check that all of these are enabled. If you haven't activated the portal yet, make sure to head into the configuration and set up a default site
